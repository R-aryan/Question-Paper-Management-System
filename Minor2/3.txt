1.Given an unsorted array. The array has this property that every element in array is at most k distance from its position in sorted array where k is a positive integer smaller than size of array. Which sorting algorithm can be easily modified for sorting this array and what is the obtainable time complexity?

A.Quick Sort With complexity – O(nlogn)
B.Heap Sort With complexity – O(nlogk)
C.Merge Sort With complexity – O(nlogn)
D.Bubble Sort With complexity – O(nlogn)
